## React internal code for execute `setState`

## React code

```
function dispatchSetState(fiber, queue, action) {
  var args = arguments;
  "function" === typeof args[3] &&
    console.error(
      "State updates from the useState() and useReducer() Hooks don't support the second callback argument.
 To execute a side effect after rendering, declare it in the component body with useEffect()."
    );
  args = requestUpdateLane(fiber);
  dispatchSetStateInternal(fiber, queue, action, args);
  markStateUpdateScheduled(fiber, args);
}
```

### ðŸ“Œ Purpose of dispatchSetState
This function is called internally when you invoke the setState function returned by useState() inside a function component.
```For example:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

// When you call:
setCount(5);

// Internally, React will call:
dispatchSetState(fiber, queue, 5);
```

### ðŸ§© Parameters
- fiber: The fiber node (i.e., the internal representation of the current React component).

- queue: The update queue for the state (tracks all pending updates).

- action: The new state (or updater function like (prev) => prev + 1).

## ðŸ”Ž Step-by-Step Breakdown
### 1. Check for an unsupported 4th argument
```
"function" === typeof args[3] && console.error(...)
args is arguments, which captures all arguments passed.
```

If a 4th argument is a function, log a warning.

Why? Because some developers try to pass a second callback to setState, like:

```setCount(5, () => console.log('Done!')); ```
But React doesnâ€™t support that in hooks. You must use useEffect instead.


### 2. Determine the Update Lane

`args = requestUpdateLane(fiber);`

React uses "lanes" to manage priority of updates (like batching, transitions).

This call figures out which lane/priority the update should be processed in.

The result (stored again in args) is the lane, not the arguments anymore.


### 3. Schedule the Update
`dispatchSetStateInternal(fiber, queue, action, args);`
This is the core function that adds your update (action) to the state queue.

It doesnâ€™t immediately apply the update â€” it queues it for the next render.

###4. Mark that the fiber has a pending state update
`markStateUpdateScheduled(fiber, args);`
Marks that this fiber has a state update pending in a particular lane.

Helps React know that it needs to re-render this component.

ðŸ§  TL;DR Summary
| Line                       | What It Does                                               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Check 4th argument         | Warns if user mistakenly passes a callback to `setState()` |
| `requestUpdateLane`        | Determines the priority lane for the update                |
| `dispatchSetStateInternal` | Adds the update to the componentâ€™s state queue             |
| `markStateUpdateScheduled` | Marks the component for an upcoming re-render              |


ðŸ”„ Real-World Trigger
When you call setCount(5) in a component, it eventually leads to this dispatchSetState function being invoked internally by React to schedule and queue the update.

Let me know if youâ€™d like a diagram of how this flows through the React Fiber tree, or an example showing how updates propagate from setState â†’ render.

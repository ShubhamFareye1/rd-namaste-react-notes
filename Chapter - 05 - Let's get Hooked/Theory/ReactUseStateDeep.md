Sure! Here's a simple step-by-step explanation of how React components and the useState hook work behind the scenes, in plain language:

âœ… 1. React Component Render Starts
When a component is rendered for the first time:

<pre>function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}</pre>
React begins building a structure behind the scenes called the Fiber Tree â€” a kind of smart to-do list for rendering updates.


âœ… 2. Fiber Node is Created
Each React component gets a fiber node. Think of it like a file folder where React stores all the componentâ€™s info â€” including the state and UI elements.


âœ… 3. Hooks (like useState) Are Stored
When useState(0) is called:
- React stores the value 0 in a special place in that fiber node â€” in a linked list of hooks.
- It also stores an internal pointer to make sure it remembers which useState corresponds to which value, especially if there are multiple useState calls.
- 

âœ… 4. Component UI is Returned
React uses the returned JSX to know what the component looks like in the UI and updates the screen accordingly.

âœ… 5. User Clicks â†’ setCount is Called
When setCount(count + 1) is triggered:
- React puts the update in a queue.
- It marks the fiber node as dirty (meaning something changed).
- Schedules a re-render of this component.

  
âœ… 6. Re-render and Hook Matching
When React re-renders:
- It walks through the hook list in order.
- It knows the first hook is useState(0), and it checks if there's a new value from setCount.
- It uses the new state value instead of the initial one.
This is why the order of hooks matters â€” React relies on the order to match old and new states.


âœ… 7. UI is Updated
React compares the new UI (Virtual DOM) with the previous one and updates only the parts that changed (efficiently using reconciliation).

ðŸ§  Summary
Step	What Happens
1.	Component starts rendering
2.	Fiber node is created
3.	useState adds value to hook list
4.	UI is shown
5.	User triggers setState
6.	Re-render uses updated state
7.	React updates only what changed
